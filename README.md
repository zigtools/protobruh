# protobruh

proto3 encoding/decoding for zig. Schema translation one day. Supports the bare minimum so that data based on `scip.proto` can properly be emitted for [scip-zig](https://github.com/zigtools/scip-zig). This is a tiny library so that I can easily copy-paste it into my project without adding any new dependencies. :)
